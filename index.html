        A croissant is a buttery, crescent-shaped French pastry. Good croissants
        are light, flaky, and delicately sweet. Enjoy one with a cup of coffee ‚Äî
        preferably while sitting in a charming Parisian cafe.

      <h3>Recipe overview</h3>
      <p>
        The first step of manufacturing croissants is the "predough" formation.
        To prepare predough, flour, water, in-dough fat, yeast, salt, and sugar
        are mixed together in a single step. Typically, croissant predough is
        mixed in a relatively cool environment, for a longer time than other
        pastries. The ideal temperature of the dough should be around 19 ¬∞C, to
        best hydrate the ingredients. In comparison to the mixing of bread dough
        ingredients, pastry predough is considered underdeveloped in that mixing
        is stopped as soon as the dough appears homogeneous, to allow for
        further dough development in the next step. The second step is the
        lamination process. Lamination is necessary to produce multilayered
        dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are
        two methods for folding fat into the dough: the English method and the
        French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers
        and three dough layers. After spreading out predough, roll-in fat is
        flattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over
        two-thirds of the surface of the laminated predough. The exposed third
        of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat, while the other
        end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the French
        method, one fold results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After
        spreading out the predough and putting a layer of roll-in fat over the
        center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded
        toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated
        until 16 fat layers are obtained. The optimal number of layers can be
        determined by balancing certain crumb properties with specific volume.
        On one hand, a low number of layers yields large specific heights as
        well as irregular crumb structure with large voids. On the other hand, a
        large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between
        different dough layers as well as less dough lift. After lamination, the
        dough is formed into its famous crescent shape. First, the laminated
        dough is cut into triangles of the desired size. The triangles are then
        rolled with three-and-a-half to four full turns, and finally, the ends
        of the roll are curved inwards to form a crescent. The third step is the
        fermentation process. Croissants are different from other puff pastries
        in that they include yeast, which, during proofing, increases the dough
        volume. Ideally, the optimum croissant quality is achieved at a yeast
        level of 7.5%, with a proof time of 60 minutes at 31 ¬∞C. The croissants
        are finished proofing when the dough has expanded two-and-a-half times
        its original volume. The fourth step is the baking process. Also known
        as "pastry lift" or "dough lift", the dough expands as water is
        converted to steam, thus increasing the pressure between each dough
        layer. As a result, the croissant dough rises up to yield its
        characteristic flaky texture. Depending on the type of oven used and
        specific size of the croissant, the baking time can range from 10 to 20
        minutes and the oven temperature can be set anywhere from 165 ¬∞C to 205
        ¬∞C. The final steps are the cooling and storage of the croissant.
        Croissants are generally not stored for very long and are typically
        consumed soon after baking.
